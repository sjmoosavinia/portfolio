description: Following my interest in website development I spent approximately 300 hours completing an online course in responsive web design on FreeCodeCamp. This gave me a grounding in HTML and CSS through the completion of exercises in applied visual design and accessibility, responsive web design principals and the CSS flexboard and grid. To test my learning, I completed series of challenges following completion of the course designing 5 different wed pages and was awarded FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Developer Certification. <b />All pages and accompanying code can be viewed on my CodePen dashboard <a href="https://codepen.io/dashboard/" target="_blank">here</a>, and full details of the course content can be found on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/" target="_blank">freecodecamp.org</a>.
