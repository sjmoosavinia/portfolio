description: During my time working at The Real Maple Company I experienced several different job roles. These included management of sales through multiple online selling platforms, running of company marketing campaigns, and the updating and maintenance of the company website. This gave me the opportunity to build upon my experience using website builders to create simple, user friendly websites for small businesses. I was responsible the updating of new products and company news as well as managing any inquires made through the site. This further developed my interest in website development and pushed me to study of HTML and CSS for knowledge of website design and well as JavaScript and PHP to expand my understanding of web development.
