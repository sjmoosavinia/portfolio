description: My initial interest in web development started when aiding in the designing and building of a website for a family run business. Using WordPress, I helped develop a website for a holiday property management business in Cornwall that was designed with the aim of being well formatted for a user friendly experience, with easy navigation and a responsive design presenting clients with information on the companyâ€™s products. Following my work in this project, I pursued my interest in website development and wanted to learn more about how I could have more control over the design of a site. The CunninghamandRound website can be viewed here http://cunninghamandround.co.uk/.
