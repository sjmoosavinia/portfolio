description: As the President of the Electrical Engineering Departmental Society (EESoc) at Imperial College, I lead a team working to cater for over thousand members, and lead relations with the College and our sponsors. The society's ultimate mission is to connect those within the department with the industries, as well as with each other. This was achieved through a series of over thirty large and small events, with attendance of up to 500 people at some. Some of the hard work of me and my team can be seen in the photos above, which includes our hackathon, which saw the conception of an award-winning project, the CarEEr Fair, as well as our major social events. We also organised many inspiring talks with a plethora of industry leaders. The result of our work can not only be witnessed in the department's careers statistics, but also in the friendly atmosphere of the department that we are proud of.
