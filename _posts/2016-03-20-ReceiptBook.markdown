description: Project ReceiptBook is the idea of digitizing this century old tradition and bringing it more in line with modern times. The ReceiptBook is an ecosystem comprising of some hardware at the vendor and a smartphone application, utilising NFC which is standard on most smartphones. Users would just be simply tap their smartphones on the NFC transmitter at the point-of-sale for the receipt and loyality rewards to be transfered to the mobile device. No wires, no delays and most importantly no pesky paper receipts lingering in the wallet/purse. As well as saving countless amount of trees and preventing wildlife habitats from being destroyed, project ReceiptBook can help in minimising financial stress commonly found in young adults, more notably students. It does this by allowing budgeting with clear visual illustrations of where money is going alongside educational tips and tricks. The ReceiptBook project combines my technical skills , developing the full stack (with jQuery, Laravel, PHP, MySQL, etc) and my business expertise to formulate a viable implementation roadmap. <br/><a href="http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/chung.poon14/yr2proj/">Learn more about this project by visiting the project website here.</a>
