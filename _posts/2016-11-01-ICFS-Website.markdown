description: As the web officer of the Imperial College Finance Society (ICFS), I developed new features for the website as well as keeping the ICFS website up-to-date with the latest trends. The website plays a major role in engaging the thousands of members within the society, as well as enabling members to be alerted and to sign up to events which has a major part in the society's success. My role also entailed creating bespoke sites to promote competitions and conferences to not only over 2000 of our society's members, but also with a reach of over 10k audience in London. These websites use the Symfony PHP framework to power its back-end, which enabled me to embrace the MVC model of web application development. On top of this, I was also became more aware of the latest techniques used in creating a stylish web designs.
