description: As part of the Machine Learning course at Imperial College London, it was my task to tackle problems such as recognising hand-written digits and building a movie recommendation engine based on previous ratings. These problems were approached using machine learning techniques where algorithms were written in MATLAB from the theory and models were trained to efficiently solve these problems. Techniques used as part of this include: ERM/Perceptron, k-fold CV, SGD, SVM (with RBF Kernel).
