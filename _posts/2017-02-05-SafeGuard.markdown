description: One of the highlight of my Embedded System project is the creation of SafeGuard. SafeGuard is part of a wider Cycle-Area-Network of sensors and indicators, with a smartphone as its hub. It is a portable all-in-one purpose device made for cyclists to aid in collision prevention. Your SafeGuard device is placed on the back of your bicycle and uses a variety of high precision sensors (such as a miniture ultrasonic sensor, accelerometer and GPS) to assess the surrounding environment and your ride, relaying all the information straight back to you on your smartphone and giving you 360 degree safety.<br/><b><a href="https://thecloudes.github.io/SafeGuard/">See the project website</a></b>
