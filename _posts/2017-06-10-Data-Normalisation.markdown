description: With the ever increasing amount of data, DNOs have to find new ways of understanding and manipulating data. During my internship at a DNO, I have been exploring ways of visualising time series demand effectively, as well as improving the compatibility and accessibility of the data. The user interface shown above is part of a component of the tool which enables data to be normalised and adjusted for engineering works being carried out, such that an ideal view of the network can be obtained. Data sources can be dragged into the system, and the manipulation operations as well as the results can be saved to be reused later.
