description: Responding to change over following a plan is one of the four cornerstones of working in the Agile Development Methodology. My work as the DevOps engineer was to implement a Continuous Integration pipeline to coordinate teams of about 30 engineers across three different timezones. This means that code committed to the team code repository is automatically built, tested and deployed locally, with the changes ready to be showcased. All of this needs to be orchestrated across the timezones to fully realise the teams' efficiency. The relevant test result is also automatically reported to the appropriate developers on the task. This also a dashboard to be developed to have full visibility of the team's progress (or 'velocity') on the task (or 'story'). My work has increased the productivity of the team by enabling quicker reaction to changes, as opposed to being surprised by an unexpected problem downstream, which may have a much bigger impact. The Agile training session pictured above involving Legos also gave the team the full confidence of working in the Agile mind-set.
