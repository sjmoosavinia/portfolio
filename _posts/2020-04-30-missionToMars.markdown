description: Through Software Cornwall I completed a remote work experience project working individually to complete a series of challenges controlling a small rover using an Arduino Duo. Initially I used TinkerCAD as a virtual circuit board to get familiar with the wiring of the rover before moving on to use the Arduino software and libraries for better control of the rovers sensors. I experienced working on code remotely using GitHub to collaborate with a supervisor and I developed new skill in  C/C++.
