client: Team Not Exactly Rocket Science, Egglescliffe School
category: Engineering &amp; Design
description: Represented school in a team in UK Aerospace Youth Rocketry Challenge, reached the Regional Final. Worked as the leader of a team of 5 tasked with designing, building and testing of rockets, to fulfil criteria such as, ensuring the payload and instruments was not damaged and reaching a narrow window of altitude, within tight constraints, in dimensions, weight, power. Choosing the appropriate material and using engineering principles was crucial in achieving such feats, whilst working within a small budget. I also had to liaise closely with sponsors and mentors in the field to assist in the project, and to gain funding support.
