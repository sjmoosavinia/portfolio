description: Lighting, heating, energy use, security and garden sprinklers are just a few of the aspects in the home that has been involved in my Smarter Home project. The key to this project is to have reliable inter-device communication. This was done by having low-level devices connected via RS485, or wirelessly through a 2.4 GHz RF mesh network. This is connected to a Raspberry Pi network master, acting as a gateway on LAN with MQTT. This enables the network to be extended using the IP protocol over MQTT in the home Wi-Fi network. Hence, with the use of the ESP8266 chip, more parts of the home is being converted. The latest examples are a home-wide audio system for voice commands and upgrades to the bathroom ventilation system with air quality monitoring. If any part of the system is compromised, the safety and comfort of me and other home occupants are seriously impaired. Therefore, there was a large emphasis of security in this project, with HMAC used to authenticate each device on the low-level network, as well as having real-time synced on start-up to prevent replay attacks.
