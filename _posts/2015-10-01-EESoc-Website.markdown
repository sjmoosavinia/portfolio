description: Being the webmaster, I had to ensure that EESoc, the student society for Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineering, was making a good first impression for the outside world, by providing web applications in today's fast-pace world with a large audience, from our sponsors to all current students in the department. I was also there to provide the society and sponsors a solid platform to advertise events and career opportunities, reaching over a thousand members, as well as creating a welcoming experience when new students are first introduced to the College, both in person and online. I also had to create and manage the internal web application managing departmental affairs, e.g. partnering new students with seniors, lockers allocation and book sales.
