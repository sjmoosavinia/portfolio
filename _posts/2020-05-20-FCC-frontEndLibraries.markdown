description: I am currently completing a course in Front End Libraries continuing on from FreeCodeCamps courses in web design and JavaScript. I have worked through introduction sections in Bootstrap, jQuery, Sass, React and Redux and I am now working on some small projects to gain qualification. This has allowed me to combine my knowledge from the previous two courses and has greatly increased the quality of my designs. <b>Full details on the content of the course can be found on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank">freecodecamp.org</a></b>.
