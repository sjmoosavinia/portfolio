                    <p>I am a keen problem solver who enjoys taking the initiative to learn and develop new skills which I am passionate about. Iâ€™m inspired by the power of new technology and want to establish a career in which I can help pursue positive change.

                    <p>During my degree in geology at Imperial College London, I first gained experience in programming using Python to handle field data. Following this, I have spent time traveling and working varied job roles in research, marketing and teaching. After returning to the UK I have taken up my interest in programming, working on small company websites and teaching myself new languages and skills. </p>
